# Tables Data

For convenience and speed of use. It's not necessary to use the database populator script to load data to the tables.

* You can import the database directly in a **POSTGRESQL** database by using the file "fifa21.sql". Which create and populates the tables.
* You can import the tables (one by one) in a **POSTGRESQL** database by using the files that ends in **\_postgres.json**
* You can also work with the data reading the tables like **Javascript Objects** by using the files that ends in **\_javascript.json**
